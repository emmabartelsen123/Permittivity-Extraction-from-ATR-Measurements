# Permittivity-Extraction-from-ATR-Measurements
Extracts complex permittivity ε(ω) from ATR reflectance using Drude–Lorentz model fitting, combining free-carrier and phonon contributions to characterize doped semiconductor thin films. Differential evolution optimization is used to fit experimental data and output frequency-dependent permittivity for optical simulations.
